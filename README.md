# E-commerce Back End 

## Description
This purpose of this project was to create the back end for an Express.js Api E-commerce site. This project contained starter code with a functional api, and my job was to use sequelize and MySql Database to build the backend and connect it. Throughout this project, I furthered my knowledge on back end development, as well as testing api routes using insomnia. This project allowed me to futher my skills using sequelize to connect to a MySql databse.

## Usage
This project uses MySQL2 package, Express.js Api, Sequelize, and dotenv packages. Insomnia is used to test the api routes.

## Installation
Open integrated terminal from the server.js, type in MySQL credentials. Run npm seed, cd back to the route and run npm start to run the port. Use insomnia to test the api routes.
